Files for my learning project
These are the CSS and Javascript files for one of my learning website, a fictional cosmetics company. The goal is to create a uniform aesthetic in line with industry expectations for the assumed customer base of such a site. Other goals include remembering to annotate code properly and ensuring the project could be handed off with ease to another developer.
